# CS279r [Tier 2] When2Meet Implementation

This code creates the basic functionalities of the characteristic that distinguish When2Meet's scheduling app for users entering their availability.

Authors: Eshika Saxena and Kat Zhang

## Key Distinguishing Characteristics

We defined the distinguishing characteristics of When2Meet as follows:

* User should be able to see availabilities of the group.
* User should drag and click on a schedule grid to indicate their availability.
* User should enter their name.
* Group availability should update as the user enters their availability.

These are the characteristics that make When2Meet different from other scheduling apps and that characterize a minimum-usable implementation.
